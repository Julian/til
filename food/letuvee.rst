L'Etuvee

Try cooking vegetables "a l'etuvee."

It retains tons of flavor. Any non-green vegetable is a good candidate
-- turnips, carrots, parsnips, cauliflower, squash, etc.

Cut them into pieces, put them flat in a pot. Fill the pot with enough
water to cover 1/4 of the vegetables. Add a hunk of butter and salt and
pepper. Cook on medium heat until the water is evaporated. Optionally,
after the water is evaporated, turn the flame up to high for a minute.
Let the bottom of the pan start to brown well. Once it's a nice dark
brown, but not black, add a tablespoon of water, and swirl everything
around the pan. The water will deglaze all the browned sugars, and make
a nice sauce that will coat your vegetables.
