Modern Slavery
==============

The legality of slavery of prisoners is literally codified in the
`thirteenth amendment <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution>`_
abolishing slavery, which states:

    Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, *except as
    a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly
    convicted,* shall exist within the United States, or any place
    subject to their jurisdiction.
