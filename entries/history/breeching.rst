Breeching
=========

Up until the late 19th or early 20th century, young boys in the western
world generally wore gowns or dresses until an age that varied between 2
and 8.

When a young boy would first wear a pair of pants, a ceremony was often held.
It was known as `breeching <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeching_(boys)>`_.
