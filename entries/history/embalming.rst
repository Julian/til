Embalming
=========

Embalming became more common in the United States `during the Civil War
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embalming#Modern_methods>`_, as a service
provided by a new profession of "embalmers" who could assist in body
retrieval given that fallen soldiers were far away from their relatives.

After the war, the embalmers continued offering their services as a
persisted part of post-mortem activities.
