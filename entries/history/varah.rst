Chad Varah, a British priest, was the creator of the world's first crisis hotline (the Samaritans, in 1953).

`He created the hotline <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Varah#Samaritans>`_ after assisting at a funeral at his first church service:

    [...] for a fourteen-year-old girl who had taken her own life because she had begun to menstruate and feared that she had a sexually transmitted disease.
    He later said "Little girl, I didn't know you, but you have changed the rest of my life for good." He vowed at that time to encourage sex education, and to help people who were contemplating suicide and had nowhere to turn.
