In Your Lap or In a Seat
========================

The FAA `recommends children (under 2) sit in their parents' lap rather than in their own seat <https://www.ntsb.gov/news/events/Documents/child_safety-Claussen.pdf>`_.

This recommendation was made based on a prediction *unrelated* to air travel safety itself.
Instead, even though young children are indeed slightly safer when placed in a restraint (and in a separate seat) while flying, the net increase in price from mandating the purchase of an additional seat would divert a sufficient fraction of parents from flying to driving so as to cause a proportionately much *larger* number of deaths on the highway, given the safety of air travel!
