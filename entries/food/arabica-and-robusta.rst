==========================
Arabica and Robusta Coffee
==========================

Arabica beans tend to be more flat and oval-shaped. They grow at higher
altitudes in slightly colder climates, contain less caffeine, and
contain more "complex" or varied flavors.

Robusta beans tend to be a bit more rounded, with straighter
creases. They grow at lower climates, contain around double the caffeine
of Arabica beans, and generally have more "bitter" tastes.
