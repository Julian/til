The word "kaffir" is an `extremely offensive racial slur in parts of the world <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaffir_%28racial_term%29>`_.

The name "makrut lime" is an alternative name for the fruit.

`This Slate article <https://slate.com/culture/2014/07/kaffir-lime-racist-murky-origins-suggest-a-racial-slur-might-be-responsible-for-the-fruits-name.html>`_ links to some further resources.

There seems to also be some discussion about "marijuana" and whether its use was motivated by racial demonization, though that seems to be quite a `bit more arguable <https://missouriindependent.com/2023/05/02/why-some-people-believe-marijuana-is-a-racist-word-and-why-it-doesnt-offend-me/>`_.
