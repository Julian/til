The `FDA rejected mandating that hens be vaccinated against salmonella

United Kingdom:

    There are no laws mandating vaccination in Britain. But it is
    required, along with other safety measures, if farmers want to place
    an industry-sponsored red lion stamp on their eggs, which shows
    they have met basic standards. The countryâ€™s major supermarkets
    buy only eggs with the lion seal, so vaccination is practiced by 90
    percent of egg producers, according to Ms. Cryer.
