Coffee Containers
=================

Coffee containers, whether they're airtight, evacuate air
or even evacuate enough air to try and create a vacuum,
`don't really affect the taste of the coffee meaningfully
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0JWuhE8a-w>`_, especially under normal
shelf-lives.

Use what you like, including the original bag.
