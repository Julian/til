Madame Wong's
=============

Madame Wong's was a restaurant in LA's Chinatown which beginning in the late 1970s became important for promoting the growth of punk music.

It was owned by `Esther Wong <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esther_Wong>`_, who ultimately became known as the "Godmother of Punk" for the restaurant's role as a punk venue.
