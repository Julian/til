The Beatles & Medicine
======================

In the 1960's, The Beatles were signed by EMI, a record company but also one which developed medical technologies.

It is commonly believed that revenue generated from the Beatles' success was used by EMI to fund the development of the CT scanner.

`Maislin & Voss (2012) <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22446352/>`_ show this to be a misconception, though an interesting one.
