Electric Guitar Knobs
=====================

Don't roll knobs immediately up to 10.

Doing so means that the only on-body adjustments that can be made are
*downward*.

Instead, set volume down at least 1 stop, and *then* set appropriate amp
settings (which will require more gain).

For tone, setting it half-way will give room in both directions.

Also, rolling the volume knob down and up can be used with high-gain amp
settings to switch between clean and distorted tones.
