Liquid Magnets
==============

There aren't really any liquid magnets.

The `Curie temperature
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curie_temperature>`_ of a material is the
temperature above which it loses its magnetic properties.

Even `ferrofluids <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrofluid>`_ are not
actually liquid magnets, they're small solid magnets suspended in a
liquid (oil).
