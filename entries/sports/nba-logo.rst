============
The NBA Logo
============

An `episode of 99PI
<https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/mini-stories-volume-12/>`_ mentioned that the NBA Logo is a silhouette of Jerry West (and that this is a widely known open secret).

The episode mentions that Jerry West doesn't like being the logo -- and also that the NBA has not publicly admitted this to be the case, but that seems to `not be true anymore <https://www.nba.com/news/qa-alan-siegel-creator-of-the-nbas-classic-logo>`_ at least as recently as that October 2021 article.
