==================
Deliberate Failure
==================

`Jono Dry's How I Plan My Drawings
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tMx5WC69mM>`_ has a nice suggestion
for how to zero in on the boundaries of an idea (in the context of an
artistic work, but it seems likely more widely applicable).

Namely -- intentionally *increase* the failure rate of what you're
trying to accomplish along deliberate lines to "cut off the excess
around a [...] vague idea that you have".

(Other more concrete insights into his artistic process there as well.)
