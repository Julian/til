========================
"Race" & Fraternal Twins
========================

Fraternal twins, which of course need not have any physical similarity,
can also differ by "race", or at least societally perceived race.

A few cases are `noted in this Vox article
<https://www.vox.com/2017/1/29/14377940/biracial-twins-black-white-race-identity>`_.

(The article also points out that this is no different from any other
physical characteristic which may differ in the same way for fraternal
twins).
