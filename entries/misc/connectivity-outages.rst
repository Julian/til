====================
Connectivity Outages
====================

There is a mailing list `hosted here
<https://puck.nether.net/mailman/listinfo/outages>`_ which tries to
centralize reporting of outages across communications infrastructure
(networks).

`NANOG <https://mailman.nanog.org/pipermail/nanog/>`_ is a broader
intentioned group, but one which typically will report or opine on
outages as well.
