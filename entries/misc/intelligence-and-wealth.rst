=======================
Intelligence and Wealth
=======================

There is `some evidence (Zagorsky, 2007) <https://www.academia.edu/download/46035865/Do_you_have_to_be_smart_to_be_rich_The_i20160529-20019-bh5h3o.pdf>`_ that in the U.S., intelligence (as measured by IQ) is not correlated with wealth, though is correlated with income and financial distress.

The paper also contains an interesting table (Table 1) containing correlation factors for a number of other features beyond IQ score.

I wasn't able to find any other relevant studies (more recent than 2007 or which studied other populations) though this study seems well regarded.
