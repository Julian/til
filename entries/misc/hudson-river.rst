====================
Hudson River Estuary
====================

The lower part of the Hudson River, in particular that surrounding
Manhattan, is `technically not a river but a tidal estuary
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_River#Geography_and_watershed>`_, as the
direction it flows can change with the tides.
