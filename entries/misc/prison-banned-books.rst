Prisons Banning Books
=====================

The state of Oregon's prisons have `banned a large number of innocuous books
which teach programming-related topics
<https://www.salemreporter.com/posts/891/oregon-prisons-ban-dozens-of-technology-and-programming-books-over-security-concerns>`_,
under the guise that learning programming and related topics constitutes a
security risk.

Other states are mentioned as doing the same in the above; (n.b. a quick
moment of searching didn't turn up an immediate article on another state, but
see below, I likely just didn't look hard enough and likely can fill this in
later with other examples).

(The `Oregon Department of Corrections
<https://www.oregon.gov/doc/Pages/default.aspx>`_ is the state entity,
not a for-profit prison.)

Other questionably-banned book categories are discussed briefly `here
