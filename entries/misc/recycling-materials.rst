Recycling Materials
===================

Recycling aluminum requires `around 5% of the energy required to
produce it from raw bauxite ore <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_recycling>`_.
It is infinitely recyclable, and as such `around 75%
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_recycling#Advantages>`_ of the
aluminum ever produced remains in use.

Glass is broken down into small particles known as cullet, which are
`mixed in proportion with new material to make new glass with less
energy <https://wwf.panda.org/knowledge_hub/teacher_resources/project_ideas/recycling_glass.cfm>`_.
