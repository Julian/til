Taylor Swift sexual assault trial
=================================

In 2013, Taylor Swift was `groped by a radio DJ <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift_sexual_assault_trial>`_, who was subsequently fired.

When the DJ sued for defamation and claimed he was wrongfully terminated, Swift countersued for battery and sexual assault, seeking $1 in compensation.

She won, and was awarded the $1.
