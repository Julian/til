Modern Chess Technicalities
===========================

The modern Chess rules had some unintended technicalities even until the
1970's.

In particular, until the rules were amended, it was possible to read the
castling rules as allowing a pawn promoted to a rook to then *vertically
castle* with a king on its original square -- i.e. ``e8=R ... o-O-o`` where the
king moves ``e1`` to ``e3`` and the new rook moves ``e8`` to ``e2?!``. This was
because the rules only specified that the rook must not have moved previously.

`This Reddit post
<https://old.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/gy2uwo/before_1972_the_castling_rule_had_a_hole_in_it/>`_
has a "puzzle" where this rule change affects the game result.

Wikipedia lists these under `joke chess problems
<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joke_chess_problem>`_ as if they were even
then already unrealistic to consider outside of in a joke, but still
interesting.

(There's also a second "funny" or "interesting" puzzle there where the rules
didn't specify that promoted pieces needed to be of the same color.)
