Cuts of Lumber
==============

There are `various ways to cut or partition a tree into lumber
<https://www.grandior.net/what-is-the-difference-between-plain-sawn-quarter-sawn-rift-sawn-and-live-sawn-lumber/>`_.

Each affects the physical and aesthetic quality of the resulting planks
in different ways, as well as the material efficiency of the cuts.

In particular, boards containing the `pith (i.e. center)
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pith>`_ of the tree are `much more unstable and
prone to warping <https://growitbuildit.com/how-to-buy-lumber-that-is-stable-and-doesnt-warp/>`_.
