`The Dutch Reach
<https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/05/smarter-living/the-dutch-reach-save-bicyclists-lives-bicycle-safety-drivers.html>`_
is a coined name for a suggestion to always open car doors using one's
opposite hand (i.e. across one's body).

It's suggested as a way to ensure one checks for ongoing cyclists coming
from behind the vehicle.
