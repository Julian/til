Winning the Olympics
====================

`This video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fR__LXDkRg>`_ has an interesting
showerthought about how to define who wins the olympics.

In short, rather than absolute number of medals (which favors large
nations) or medals per capita (which favors small nations), a
probabilistic-y combination of them is proposed (that's obviously the
technical term for it. Essentially it's calculating which nations did
better than expected probabilistically given their size).

Absolutely imperfect, but fun to think about.
