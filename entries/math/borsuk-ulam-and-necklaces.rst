The Borsuk-Ulam Theorem and Stolen Necklaces
============================================

:tags: theorems, combinatorics

`This 3b1b video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuVqxCSsE7c>`_ overviews the
Borsuk-Ulam Theorem, and its applications for the `Necklace Splitting problem
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necklace_splitting_problem>`_.

It's a super nice connection between topology and combinatorics.
