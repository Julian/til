TIL
===

Small tidbits I've learned, with only a touch of order and cleanliness.

The rendered version of these notes is `here <https://til.grayvines.com>`_. The
notes are also available as an `Anki deck built on each push
<https://github.com/Julian/til/actions>`_ as an artifact.

I take a small bit of liberty with the TIL concept -- in particular,
take the dates with a grain of salt. Some things here are "facts I want
to remember" moreso than commemorating the day I learned them, which may
have been earlier (or later if I have by now discovered time travel).

If you notice something I've learned that's still wrong, correcting me
would be amazingly appreciated!

And of course, a usual disclaimer -- I am not a doctor, a medical
researcher or a lawyer, so despite anything that may seem relevant to
those fields, do not take my advice on medicine or law!

Inspired by `<https://github.com/jbranchaud/til>`_ and its post on
Orange Site.

A lot of what's in here is indebted to Snoo, or to aforeunmentioned
Orange Site. We make fun of you, but you're also great. Keep on keeping
on.

Where possible and prudent, at least a few minutes effort was made to go
find the best source of the tidbit.
